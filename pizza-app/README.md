# Pizza Order Tracker

A pizza ordering system built from three microservices and a web frontend.

## What's Inside

- **Order Service** (Port 3000): Receives pizza orders and coordinates with other services
- **Kitchen Service** (Port 3001): Checks availability and cooks pizzas
- **Delivery Service** (Port 3002): Assigns drivers for delivery
- **Frontend** (Port 8080): Simple web UI for ordering pizzas

## Architecture

└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## Running the App

```bash
docker compose up
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 and order a pizza.

To stop it:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Observability

All three Node services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry's zero-code
auto-instrumentation and export traces, logs and metrics to Dash0 over
OTLP/gRPC. Nothing in `index.js` knows about it:

- `package.json` pulls in `@opentelemetry/api` and
  `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`, and the `start` script becomes
  `node --require @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register index.js`.
- `docker-compose.yml` passes the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables,
  including the Dash0 endpoint and token read from `.env`.

The frontend can additionally send browser telemetry (page views, Core Web
Vitals, JavaScript errors, and HTTP calls that link into the backend trace) via
the Dash0 Web SDK. It stays off until `DASH0_WEB_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, since that
token is public once served to a browser.

See the [root README](../README.md) for the setup steps.

## Watching What Happens

The terminal shows all four services interleaved:

```
order-service    | {"level":30,...,"orderId":"PIZZA-123...","msg":"Order received"}
kitchen-service  | {"level":30,...,"orderId":"PIZZA-123...","msg":"Starting to cook"}
delivery-service | {"level":30,...,"orderId":"PIZZA-123...","msg":"Assigning driver"}
```

One service on its own:

```bash
docker compose logs -f kitchen-service
```

## Failure Modes You Can Switch On

### Slow Kitchen (Oven is Broken)
```bash
SLOW_KITCHEN=true docker compose up
```

Every pizza takes about five seconds longer to cook.

### No Drivers Available
```bash
NO_DRIVERS=true docker compose up
```

Delivery has nobody to assign, so orders fail.

## Services Overview

### Order Service
- Receives orders from the frontend
- Calls Kitchen Service to check availability and cook
- Calls Delivery Service to assign a driver
- Returns order confirmation

### Kitchen Service
- Checks if kitchen is available
- Simulates cooking time
- Can be configured to be slow (SLOW_KITCHEN=true)

### Delivery Service
- Finds available drivers
- Assigns driver to order
- Can be configured to have no drivers (NO_DRIVERS=true)

### Frontend
- Simple HTML form
- Sends orders to Order Service
- Displays confirmation
